# XRPHWallet
A secure crypto wallet specifically designed to hold your XRPH. 

Allows for sending and receiving XRPH and provides opportunities for discounts on select medications from supported pharmaceutical retailers including Walgreens, CVS, Target Pharmacy, Walmart Pharmacy, and more.

## Project Breakdown
This app will be available on iOS and Android devices in a few months time. Its purpose is to allow for secure holding and transactions of XRPH from the convenience of a mobile device. The app will also provide a pharmaceutical coupon card that can be used for up to 80% off medications at the above list of supported retailers.

## Code Breakdown
The majority of the code for this project is front-end code. Back-end functions include sending and receiving XRP and XRPH. In order to send and receive XRPH, a trustline is created.
